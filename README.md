# Getting Started

1. `npm install` on the root directory;
2. Then `npm install` on the `./server` and `./client` directories;
3. Finally to run them both: `npm run local` on the root directory.

Starting the app and navigating to "localhost:5173/payments" takes the user to the Payments Page. On this page a user gets continuous updates of the current code generated by the server. Filling the Name and amount text and number inputs, respectively, unblocks the ADD button on the top right. If the user presses this button the server receives a payment, stores it and notifies all connected clients about this new payment. The server stores each payment on a local json file that does the job of a simple persistent database.
